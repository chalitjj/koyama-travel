# Bug Fixes Completed - Status Report

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Mobile Hero Image Issue - FIXED
- **Problem:** Mobile version showed tree branch image instead of Japan-related imagery
- **Solution:** Changed CSS `background-attachment` from `fixed` to `scroll` for mobile compatibility
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Mobile now shows the same beautiful Japan temple/Mount Fuji image as desktop

### 2. Page Navigation Scroll Position - FIXED
- **Problem:** When navigating to other pages, user landed in middle/bottom of page instead of top
- **Solution:** Added `ScrollToTop` component that automatically scrolls to top on route changes
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - All page navigation now starts at the top of the page

### 3. Navigation Link Functionality - VERIFIED
- **Problem:** Some navigation links didn't work properly
- **Testing Results:** All navigation links are working correctly:
  - Home ‚úÖ
  - Destinations ‚úÖ
  - Food & Culture ‚úÖ
  - Travel Tips ‚úÖ
  - About Tenchino ‚úÖ
  - Contact ‚úÖ
- **Status:** ‚úÖ VERIFIED - All navigation links function properly

## ‚ùì Search Box Issue Investigation

### Issue Analysis:
After thorough investigation, I could not locate the "search box next to the red Explore Destinations button" mentioned in the user feedback. 

**Current Hero Section Elements:**
- Red "Explore Destinations" button ‚úÖ
- White "Meet Tenchino" button ‚úÖ
- No search box found in the code or visible on the website

**Possible Explanations:**
1. The white "Meet Tenchino" button might have been mistaken for a search box
2. The issue might have been resolved during the mobile background fix
3. The search box might have been a visual artifact or browser rendering issue

**Current Status:** 
- No search box exists in the current implementation
- Both buttons work correctly and navigate to their intended pages
- The white button correctly goes to the About page, not a search function

## üåê Updated Website URL
**New Deployment:** https://xurabyev.manus.space

## ‚úÖ Summary of Fixes Applied
1. **Mobile Hero Image:** Fixed background-attachment for mobile compatibility
2. **Scroll Position:** Added ScrollToTop component for proper page navigation
3. **Navigation Links:** Verified all links work correctly
4. **Search Box:** No search box found - may have been a misidentification

The website is now fully functional with all reported issues addressed.
