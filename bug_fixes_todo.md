# Bug Fixes Required

Based on user feedback, the following issues need to be addressed:

## 1. Mobile Hero Image Issue
- **Problem:** Mobile version shows tree branch image instead of Japan-related imagery
- **Expected:** Should show the same beautiful Japan temple/Mount Fuji image as desktop
- **Fix:** Update CSS to ensure consistent hero background across all devices

## 2. Search Box Navigation Bug
- **Problem:** Clicking the search box next to "Explore Destinations" button redirects to "About Tenchino" page
- **Expected:** Should allow text input for search functionality
- **Fix:** Remove incorrect link wrapping and implement proper search functionality

## 3. Page Navigation Scroll Position
- **Problem:** When navigating to other pages, user lands in middle/bottom of page instead of top
- **Expected:** Should scroll to top of page when navigating
- **Fix:** Implement scroll-to-top functionality on route changes

## 4. Navigation Link Functionality
- **Problem:** Some navigation links don't work properly or show incomplete content
- **Expected:** All links should work and show appropriate content or "Under Construction" message
- **Fix:** Ensure all routes are properly configured and show appropriate content

## Priority Order
1. Fix mobile hero image (critical visual issue)
2. Fix search box navigation bug (functional issue)
3. Fix page scroll position (UX issue)
4. Verify all navigation links work (functionality check)
